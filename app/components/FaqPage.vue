We invite anyone between the ages of 17 and 35, who is able to study full-time for two years at one of our campuses in South Africa to apply. No prior education or coding experience is required.",

The assessment is designed for both those with prior coding experience as well as applicants that have never coded before. We introduce applicants to new concepts and evaluate their ability to grasp the concepts and then apply them to solve problems.",
